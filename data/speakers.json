In the many years since the birth of The Web we’ve moved more towards centralized structures to solve the issues of scale and data and it has not come without consequence. In order to move past these issues we need new primitives for a new vision of The Web that can be decentralized.",

This talk is all about how to keep your code DRY, scalable, and maintainable- the dream trifecta!- regardless of its size and scope. Creating “ducks”, or modularized components, allows you to keep all of your state in one place and avoid creating a new file for every single action and reducer. This talk will cover how to create those ducks!",
