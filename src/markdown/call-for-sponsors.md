The most important thing we do as a conference is bring developers together to meet, build relationships and learn from one another. Many of the attendees who come to CascadiaJS do so because they are trying to learn new skills, become better engineers, build their professional network or find a new job. For companies that are hiring or building products for developers, sponsoring CascadiaJS is a great way to connect with these folks.
