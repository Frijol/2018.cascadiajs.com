The most important thing we do as a conference is bring developers together to meet, build relationships and learn from one another. Many of the attendees who come to Cascadia do so because they are trying to learn new skills, become better engineers, build their professional network or find a new job. 

For companies that are hiring or building products for developers, sponsoring CascadiaJS is a natural way to connect with folks who are looking for jobs or interested in checking out new and interesting tools. The best sponsorships don't feel like sponsorships at all. They feel like an integrated part of the curated conference experience and they help to serve attendees, rather than distract them.

To that end, we are asking companies who would like to sponsor CascadiaJS to submit a request to sponsor. We want to make sure it's a good fit for your company and our community! ❤️

## Code of Conduct 

Please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cascadiajs/2018.cascadiajs.com/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). Everyone who participates in our conference agrees to the enforcement of our CoC, and includes our friends, speakers, staff, sponsors, and attendees.
