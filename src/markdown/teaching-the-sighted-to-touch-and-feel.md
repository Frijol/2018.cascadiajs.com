<div>Braille is becoming more and more ubiquitous in many common spaces â€” airports, malls,libraries, etc. A college in Oregon needed a web app built to help teach the friends &amp; family of those who are sight impaired how to read Braille. Faddah Wolf will go over what accessibility options there are in common Mobile OSes and how he created a React Native six-key-input keyboard for Braille and how you can contribute to this Open Source project.</div>
