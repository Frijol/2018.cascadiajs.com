<div>React and Redux are awesome but the state management can be overwhelming for beginners. This talk is all about how to keep your code DRY, scalable, and maintainable- the dream trifecta!- regardless of its size and scope. Creating “ducks”, or modularized components, allows you to keep all of your state in one place and avoid creating a new file for every single action and reducer. This talk will cover how to create those ducks!</div>
