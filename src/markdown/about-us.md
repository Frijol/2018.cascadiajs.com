CascadiaJS is a conference for web developers, by web developers. It was started in 2012 by folks in the Pacific Northwest to better connect and celebrate the amazing work of the developers communities across the region. We have held CascadiaJS in Washington, Oregon and British Columbia and are returning to Seattle, where we started, for our 2018 event.

We run CascadiaJS for the benefit of developers and the developer community. We care about helping people break into tech, learn new skills, meet interesting people and have fun with each other. 

## Community

CascadiaJS exists to educate and grow the web development community in the Pacific Northwest. Every year, we strive to make our community broader and more inclusive. We spend a lot of organizing energy encouraging community members from under-represented groups in tech to attend and participate. 

## Leveling Up

## Having Fun

An important part of helping folks connect is creating an inclusive and fun environment. We've thrown pool parties, karaoke jams and a Hacker Olympics competition complete with medals and prizes. It's important after a long day of talks for people to be able to unwind and enjoy time with all the new friends you've made.
