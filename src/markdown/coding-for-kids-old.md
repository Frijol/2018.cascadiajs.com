Following the conference, we are working with Microsoft to host a Coding for Kids workshop at the Microsoft Reactor in South Lake Union. This event is inspired by a [cool experience](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/will-8-year-old-girl-stick-coding-fun-project-dad-attracts-gifts-tech-community/) that a local 2nd grader had learning to code and collecting dev stickers this past summer. The goal of this event is to introduce area kids to coding in a *welcoming* and *fun* environment. We will have a bunch of different workshops targeted at different age groups, so there should be something for everybody. Here are some important details:

We are in the process of finalizing the list of workshops, but here are a few examples of what we're going to offer. 

## Workshop: Tessel Photo-Tweeter

![tessel](/tessel.png)

**Description:** Build a portable photo-bot that takes pictures and posts them to Twitter! Start by making your own social-media-happy robot, then build from there: Can you @-tweet to it to ask it for a photo? What if you could make it take a picture by clapping? What if it did something right before taking the picture that made the photo subjects react? What if it took a picture every 4 seconds, like a time lapse? Extra hardware/sensors will be around, and so will mentors. What will you build?

**Age range:** Recommended for middle school and up. No prior experience with software or hardware required. But for the pros, this workshop is designed to let you set your own challenge!
