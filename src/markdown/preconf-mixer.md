In order to make CascadiaJS as inclusive as possible, we have spent the last few years awarding scholarships to folks who belong to under-represented groups in tech or have financial constraints that would otherwise prevent them from attending. This year we set an audacious goal of funding and awarding 50 scholarships.

But giving someone a free ticket to a conference isnâ€™t enough! In order to ensure that these folks get the most out of their time at CascadiaJS, we are organizing a pre-conf mixer. The goal of this event is to invite respected and enthusiastic community members to give back and connect with people are new to the Tech community or early in their career.  mentors can provide suggestions on how to make the most out of conference experience, advice on advancing their career,  and giving general help.
Agenda:

5 - 5:15 (arrive & check-in)
5:15 - 5:30 (welcome + agenda + thanks)
5:30 - 6:15 (group discussion)
6:15 - 6:30 (break)
6:30 - 7 (mingle)

[ RSVP as a scholarship recipient ]
