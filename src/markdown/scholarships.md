CascadiaJS exists to educate and grow the JavaScript community in the Pacific Northwest. We're constantly seeking new ways to make our community broader and more inclusive, so we're excited to work with our community to fund a Scholarship Program.

The Scholarship Program is open to **all residents of the Pacific Northwest who are able to travel to Seattle, WA and attend CascadiaJS from Nov 15–16.** Please let us know if you are a member of an under-represented minority (URM) in tech or if you have financial constraints that would otherwise prevent you from attending the conference.

The recipients of a Scholarship will receive:
* A ticket to the conference
* Lodging for the nights of Nov 14, 15 and 16
* Travel to the conference


## Sponsor a Scholarship
We'd love to be able to provide as many scholarships as possible, and we need your help! If you're a company interested in sponsoring a scholarship, please check-out our [Call for Sponsors](/call-for-sponsors). For every sponsorship you fund, you get one free pass to the conference.

## Spread the Word
Finally, please help us in our outreach efforts. Take a moment to share this post with relevant people or organizations. We hope this Scholarship Program can enable you to join us and contribute to our community!
