title: "Getting to Seattle"
---

For those of you who don't live in Seattle, we have you covered! Please see below for more information about how to get to Seattle and where to stay while you're here.

## Schedule

In order to best plan your stay, here is a rough schedule of events. We will continue adding more and more fun activities, but these are the core parts of CascadiaJS:

* Wednesday - Speaker Dinner & Mentee Mixer
* Thursday - Day One Talk & Opening Party
* Friday - Day Two Talk & Closing Party
* Saturday - React Training

## Hacker Trains

All aboard the Hacker Train! If you live in Portland, OR or Vancouver, BC there is **no better way** to get to CascadiaJS than to join your fellow devs on the Hacker Train. We have bought out cars on both a northbound train departing Portland, OR and a southbound train departing Vancouver, BC so that you can make some friends, fork repos on the in-train Wi-Fi and enjoy the beautiful views along the Puget Sound as you head to Seattle.

*NOTE: the Hacker Train is one way! Make sure you book a return trip*
