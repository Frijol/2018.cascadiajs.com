### Directions from the King St Station to the Moxy Seattle or Thompson Seattle hotels

We advise using a car sharing service, there aren't great public transportation options here and it's not very walkable.

### Directions from the Thompson Seattle to the Amazon Meeting Center (0.5 mile walk)

* Head northwest on 1st Ave towards Lenora
* Turn right and head northeast on Lenora
* Arrive

### Directions from the Moxy Seattle to the Amazon Meeting Center (0.6 mile walk)

* Head west on Republican St
* Turn left and head south on Westlake Ave
* Turn right onto Lenora
* Arrive

### Directions from the Amazon Meeting Center to Cinerama (0.2 mile walk)

* Head southwest on Lenora
* Arrive (4th & Lenora)

### Directions from the Amazon Meeting Center to the Living Computer Museum 

We have blocked off time in between the end of the conference and the beginning of the Closing Party for attendees to get dinner in Seattle and make their way to Living Computers. There are dozens of great places to eat in between the conference venue and Westlake Station, if you plan on taking the Light Rail. This will involve 1.3 total miles of walking:

* Walk to Westlake Station (0.4 miles)
* Take Light Rail to Stadium Station
* Walk to Living Computers (0.9 miles)

You can also take the local 21 bus (Westwood Village Via 35th Ave SW):

* Head southwest on Lenora
* Turn left on Virgina
* Hop on bus at 3rd Ave & Virginia St
* Hop off bus at 1st Ave S & S Stacy St
* Walk north half a block
* Arrive
