One of the goals for CascadiaJS this year is to build a platform that members of our community can leverage to do good in our community. Good comes in many flavors: helping folks acquire skills, connecting mentees to mentors, running a scholarship program, organizing fun activities, the sky's the limit. The highlights are:

* Let us know what you want to accomplish and what the measurable goals are.
* Let us know what resources you need (people, funding, promotion, etc).
* Commit to regular check-ins with conference organizers on progress.
* Deadline is submit is Friday, June 29th.

Please review the information below before you submit to the Call for Organizers.

## Resources

CascadiaJS can provide the following resources:

* Funding (either from ticket sales or sponsors)
* Promotion (Twitter, Mailing List, Slack)
* People (we can help you connect with volunteers)

## Perks

If we accept your proposal, we will provide a free ticket to the conference.  

## Proposal Ideas

There are several programs we've either run in the past or have thought about running in the future. Choosing one of these ideas does not mean your proposal is more likely to be accepted, so if you've got an A+ idea that you are passionate about and think will make a difference, please propose it!

* Diversity scholarships
* Mentor / Mentee connections
* Better networking
* Working better with regional meetups
* Helping folks get into tech
